Detecting Sign Language Characters in Real Time Using MediaPipe and Keras

Many large training datasets for Sign Language are available on Kaggle, a popular resource for data science. The one used in this model is called “Sign Language MNIST” and is a public-domain free-to-use dataset with pixel information for around 1,000 images of each of 24 ASL Letters, excluding J and Z as they are gesture-based signs.
